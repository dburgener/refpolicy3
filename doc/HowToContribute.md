# Contributing

If you are interested in working on Reference Policy, feel free to
contact the developers on the Reference Policy mailing
list. To join the mail list, send a plaintext email to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
containing "subscribe selinux-refpolicy" in the body. All public
development related discussion happens on this mailing list. The IRC
channel, \#selinux on irc.libera.chat, is also appropriate for
development discussions.

Reference Policy changes should be submitted by pull requests on GitHub or
by sending patches to the mail list. Pull requests on GitHub are preferred.

## Developers Certificate of Origin

Each patch is required to include a Signed-off-by certifying that you wrote the
patch or are otherwise authorized to contribute it as open source. You must use
your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

## Patches via Mail List

When submitting patches, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- It is strongly preferred (but not required) that patches be created
  by "git format-patch -n -s" **and** sent via "git send-email". This
  will ensure the patch can be directly imported into the repository,
  if accepted. Please ensure that the [name and email
  address](http://github.com/guides/tell-git-your-user-name-and-email-address)
  are correct on your patches before committing to your local repo.
- It is a common convention to prefix your subject line with [PATCH].
  This lets people easily distinguish patches from other e-mail
  discussions. Use of additional markers after PATCH and the closing
  bracket to mark the nature of the patch is also encouraged. E.g.
  [PATCH/RFC] is often used when the patch is not ready to be applied
  but it is for discussion, [PATCH v2], [PATCH v3] etc. are often seen
  when you are sending an update to what you have previously sent.

## How To Create A Patch Set for the Mail List

- A patch should make one logical change. Don't make multiple,
  disjoint changes to different modules in a single patch.
- A given patch should not break anything, even if later patches fix
  the problems that it causes. The tree should still compile after
  each patch is applied. (This makes "git bisect" work correctly.)
- Include a Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@domain.com> in your
  commit messages.  "git commit -s" is one way to easily add it.
- Patches should be relative to HEAD of the git master branch.
- Make patches relative to the top of the policy source tree (the
  directory where the Makefile and build.conf are). This is
  automatically done when using git format-patch.
- A summary email that describes the set should also be sent for patch
  sets that consist of many patches. Typically this is patch 0, e.g.
  [PATCH 0/4]
- A link to a git repo from which the set can be pulled is preferred
  if the patch set is very large.
